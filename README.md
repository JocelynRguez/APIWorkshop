## Instructions

### Task #1

Our first task for you to get familiar with JQuery is animating a circle. The circle is already created for you, the challenge will be to change its width so that it grows in size and then shrinks to its original shape when you click on it.

You will be writing your code in the `changeBackground()` function.

Some suggestions on how to start:
- look at JQuery `animate()` documentation: https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/eff_animate.asp


### Task #2

Our second task requires us to work with GIPHY API. An API stands for Application programming interface. API's are used as tools for developers to build applications/websites.

We will be exploring GIPHY API:
